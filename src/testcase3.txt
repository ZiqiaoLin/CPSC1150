onathan Holzman, associate professor in the School of Engineering, says Stirling is at the top of his class and comes across as a disciplined and remarkably humble student. Holzman runs the Integrated Optics Laboratory at UBC Okanagan and Stirling is on his research team — working on terahertz generation and spectroscopy (experimenting with the different frequencies of light and comparing those with the frequencies of electrons).

“Trevor personifies excellence. He excels in academics and athletics,” says Holzman. “And he has put forward major contributions to our research on terahertz technology. He truly is one of our nation's rising stars."

While he will represent Canada at the World Trampoline and Tumbling Championships next week, Stirling knows the competition is top-notch. It’s literally the best in the world. He has no grand illusions about winning it all.

“This competition is a qualifier for the Olympics and the top eight will get a spot,” he says. “Even now I know it’s not a possibility for me in 2016. I’m aiming to score about 100 points this competition, and I know I’ll be a bit behind the leaders who will probably earn about 110.”

While competing in Odense, he will also soak up the atmosphere of the international competition.  He has been competing for years, first as a junior, and each international event is a chance to watch the world’s best athletes, learn from them, and improve on his own skills. And he will come back from the world finals just in time for the first-semester final exams. That’s his reality.

“I have had to miss a lot of school and the professors have been really good about supporting me,” he says. “They know, when I’m not in class, I’m competing somewhere.”
