This is it: the last day before we leave for our cross-country canoe trip.

We’re here in Alberta staying with Harry’s family. Tomorrow, his mother will drive us down to Lake Louise and drop us off east of the town site at a spot along the Bow River where we’ll put the canoe in the water and begin our journey!

Looking back from this point, preparing for both the trip and the wedding was even more work than either of us had imagined. Would we do it differently if we could? Absolutely not.

The most difficult part of the trip planning was preparing the food and supplies to be mailed to our re-stocking locations. (Luckily for me, this was Harry’s job!) Once we had mapped out the stops along our route based on an estimated 40 kilometers of paddling per day, we made a schedule of where and when we will pass through towns and what types of supplies are available. We noted a couple of locations that will be the last stops before several daylong stretches with no access to towns or grocery stores. In the prairies, many of the towns marked on the map are ghost towns, with no shops, houses or any inhabitants at all!
